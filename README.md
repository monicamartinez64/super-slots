2. The user first has to place a bet in order to be able to spin and play the game.

3. Once the user has placed a bet, they can click on the spin button, which prompts a function that renders three random images, one in each slot.

4. If the images are not identical to each other, then the user loses their bet and their earnings remain at 0. A "spin again" message is displayed on the screen.

5. If the images are identical, the bet is multiplied by the value assigned to the figure, according to the probability of this image rendering.

6. After this the user may place another bet, spin again and try to win some money. Alternatively, the user can cash out to collect and clear their earnings by clicking the "cash out" button.

## Starter Pseudocode: 
1. Define Variables - slot 1, slot 2, slot 3, machine(board).
2. Create a function to randomize the slots, which is triggered by a “spin” button.
3. Create an array of possible win combinations? OR Create win logic: if slot 1 is equal to slot 2 and slot 3,  then display win image.
4. Create a reset “spin again” button.


## Minimum Viable Product:
1. User should be able to play by hitting the spin button once a bet is placed. 
2. The images will randomly render, and display a win/loss message depending on whether the images match.
3. The user should be able to spin again or collect earnings based on win/loss logic.
4. User should be able to "cash out" in order to clear earnings and restart game.

## Future Goals:
1. Add sound effects to spin button.
2. Add sound effect if user wins or loses.
3. Add flash effect to each slot after user clicks spin.
4. Add a difficulty option to game, which renders a larger slot machine of 5 in a row for medium and 9 in a grid for high.
